# Finding the True Value of NFTs: Artistic Hype

Submitted to Synopsys Science Fair (2022)

Abstract: Non-Fungible Tokens, NFTs have been a buzzword in the past year and generated a $22B industry that only
seems to be growing. Turning digital images and other media content into assets is a relatively new concept, with
a high barrier of entry for potential creators wanting to profit.
This study investigates what gives NFTs their value by creating and training a machine learning model to input
NFTs and output a value estimate, and additionally performing clustering analysis on NFTs for clearer observation
of common traits between higher and lower earners respectively. For the purposes of this study, the value of an
NFT is the value of its last successful transaction, as opposed to other metrics such as market value or lowest ask.
With the hypothesis that art and NFT value are not correlated, a convolutional neural network(CNN) model was
created to predict the price of an NFT simply given the image and no other metadata. The results of the modeling
showed a low accuracy of ~0.3 and a loss of ~1.9, indicating a low correlation between the features extracted by

the model and the monetary value of the token. The cluster analysis showed that NFTs had certain style traits giv-
ing an advantage for value, such as being pixelated.

The results indicate that NFT prices are not based upon the artistic talent and techniques that go into creating
them. As such, NFT minters and creators must search for other factors that correlate with a high market value.
